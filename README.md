# FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains five data analysis and visualization projects that I completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification. Each project involves real-world datasets and demonstrates my skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
